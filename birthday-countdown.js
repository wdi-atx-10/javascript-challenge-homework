/*
  Create a function `daysUntilDate` that accepts a string (with the format `"mm/dd/yyyy"`) and
  returns the number of days (integer) between today and that date. Please use the built in
  Javascript `Date` type in your solution.
  See: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date
  Next, create a function `birthdayReminder` that accepts an array of objects, containing a person's
  date of birth (dob), and returns an array of reminder messages (strings).
  ```javascript
  birthdayReminder([
    {
      name: "Jack",
      dob: "10/31/2013"
    },
    {
      name: "Jill",
      dob: "4/01/1975"
    }
  ]);
  //=> [
  //      "Jack's birthday is in 75 days",
  //      "Jill's birthday is in 305 days"
  //    ]
  ```
  Bonuses
  - Will your function still work tomorrow when the date is different? Is it future proofed?
  - To make your output more relevant, can you sort by days remaining (ascending)?

//PseudoCode

//get user input of date
//change date to 11/11/2017 format if not entered by user that way
//save date
//calculate date from todays date
//display days until

// YOUR CODE HERE
//this only does one birthday

var myBirthday, today, bday, diff, days;
myBirthday = [11,8];
today = new Date();
bday = new Date(today.getFullYear(),myBirthday[1]-1,myBirthday[0]);
if( today.getTime() > bday.getTime()) {
    bday.setFullYear(bday.getFullYear()+1);
}
diff = bday.getTime()-today.getTime();
days = Math.floor(diff/(1000*60*60*24));
console.log("Days until birthday: " + days);
//=> [
//      "Jack's birthday is in 75 days",
//      "Jill's birthday is in 305 days"
//    ]
